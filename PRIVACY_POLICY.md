# WakeWise Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 2025

## Overview
WakeWise is a smart alarm application that uses sleep data to wake you at optimal times during light sleep phases.

## What We Collect
- Sleep data from your connected Garmin device (sleep stages, duration, timestamps)
- Alarm preferences and settings you configure
- Wake feedback ratings you provide

## How We Use It
- All data is processed locally on your device
- Used solely to analyze sleep patterns and predict optimal wake times
- We do not transmit your data to external servers

## Data Storage
- All data is stored locally on your device using secure storage
- You can delete all data anytime via Settings > Clear Data
- Disconnecting your Garmin account removes API access but preserves historical data unless you clear it

## Third Parties
- We do not sell, share, or transmit your data to any third parties
- Garmin authentication is handled securely via OAuth
- We only request read access to sleep data from Garmin

## Data Security
- Your Garmin credentials are never stored by WakeWise
- Authentication tokens are stored securely on your device
- All communication with Garmin APIs uses HTTPS

## Your Rights
- You can disconnect your Garmin account at any time
- You can delete all stored data at any time
- You can uninstall the app to remove all local data

We may update this policy occasionally. Continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of any changes.
